## Installation

ansi-parse can be installed with `opam`:

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][doc]
and there is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the
distribution.

## Sample programs

If you installed ansi-parse with `opam` sample programs are located in
the directory `opam config var ansi-parse:doc`.

In the distribution sample programs and tests are located in the
main and [`driver`](driver) directories of the distribution. They can be
built and run with:

    OCAMLRUNPARAM=b dune build -p ansi-parse @runtest

The resulting binaries are:

- `_build/default/test3.exe`
- `_build/default/driver/driver.exe`

## Local Development

Build, test and pin your locally checked out repository with:

    opam install . --verbose --with-test --with-doc

Your changes, if any, must be `git commit`-ed for opam install to see
your changes.
